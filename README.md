# SkyGuard - Open-Source Raptor Alert System

![SkyGuard Logo](skyGuardShield.png)

**Protecting Small Poultry Farms with AI-Powered Raptor Detection**

SkyGuard is an open-source artificial intelligence solution that alerts small flock owners when raptors are circling above their coops. Built for affordability and accessibility, it uses low-cost hardware and modern computer vision to protect your poultry from airborne predators.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Author:** John Daughtridge  

### The Problem

- 11M Homes in the US keep chickens for food and companionship
- 49% of surveyed chicken owners cite hawks and other airborne predators as their #1 concern
- Rising egg prices and supply concerns drive more families to backyard chicken farming
- Existing deterrent systems are costly and sized for airports or industrial farms
- Small-scale farmers lack affordable protective solutions

### The Solution

SkyGuard provides a low-cost, AI-driven alert system that:
- Uses generic webcams and inexpensive microcontrollers (ESP32/Raspberry Pi)
- Runs real-time computer vision models to detect raptors
- Sends immediate alerts via audio, push notifications, or SMS
- Logs detection events for analysis and improvement
- Is completely open-source and self-contained

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Detection**: AI-powered computer vision using YOLO models
- **Multiple Alert Types**: Audio, push notifications, SMS, and email alerts
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive detection history and statistics
- **Web Portal**: Full-featured web interface for system management
- **REST API**: Complete API for integration and automation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test suite for reliability
- **Low Cost**: ~$150 per unit using affordable hardware
- **Easy Setup**: Complete documentation and automated configuration
- **Open Source**: Full source code available on GitHub
- **Extensible**: Modular design for future enhancements

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jad3tx/SkyGuard.git
   cd SkyGuard
   ```

2. **Follow the installation guide**
   See **[Raspberry Pi 5 Setup Guide](docs/RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md)** for complete step-by-step instructions:
   - OS imaging and initial setup
   - System configuration
   - SkyGuard installation
   - Auto-startup configuration
   - Troubleshooting

### Installation Guide

The [Raspberry Pi 5 Setup Guide](docs/RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md) covers:
- ‚úÖ Complete setup from OS imaging to deployment
- ‚úÖ Pi 5 optimizations and performance tuning
- ‚úÖ Auto-startup with systemd services
- ‚úÖ Web portal configuration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive troubleshooting

For general installation overview, see [INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

SkyGuard is configured through the `config/skyguard.yaml` file. Key settings include:

- **Camera settings**: Resolution, FPS, rotation
- **AI model parameters**: Confidence thresholds, detection classes
- **Notification preferences**: Audio, SMS, email, push notifications
- **Storage options**: Database location, image retention
- **Hardware configuration**: GPIO pins, platform-specific settings

See [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed configuration options.

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Configure the system**
   ```bash
   ./skyguard-setup
   ```

2. **Start the detection system**
   ```bash
   ./skyguard-main
   ```

3. **Access the web portal**
   ```bash
   python scripts/start_web_portal.py
   # Open http://<PI_IP>:8080 in your browser
   ```

4. **Monitor detections**
   - View real-time detection feed
   - Check alert notifications
   - Review detection logs
   - Use the web interface for easy management

### Service Management

The installer sets up systemd services for automatic startup:

```bash
# Start services
sudo systemctl start skyguard.service
sudo systemctl start skyguard-web.service

# Check status
sudo systemctl status skyguard.service

# Stop services
sudo systemctl stop skyguard.service
sudo systemctl stop skyguard-web.service

# Enable/disable auto-start
sudo systemctl enable skyguard.service
sudo systemctl disable skyguard.service
```

### Cleanup (if needed)

```bash
# Remove all services for testing
./scripts/cleanup_skyguard.sh
```

### Web Portal Features

- **Dashboard**: Real-time system status and statistics
- **Detection Management**: Browse and export detection history
- **Configuration**: Easy system configuration through web interface
- **System Monitoring**: Test camera, AI model, and alert systems
- **API Access**: REST API for integration and automation

### Advanced Features

- **Custom model training**: See [TRAINING.md](docs/TRAINING.md)
- **Multi-camera setup**: Configure multiple detection zones
- **Remote monitoring**: Web interface for remote system management
- **Data export**: Export detection data for analysis
- **API integration**: Use REST API for custom applications

## üìä Performance Metrics

SkyGuard is designed to achieve:
- **>80% detection accuracy** for common raptor species
- **<2 second response time** from detection to alert
- **24/7 operation** with minimal maintenance
- **Low power consumption** for continuous operation
