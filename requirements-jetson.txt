# SkyGuard - NVIDIA Jetson Optimized Dependencies
# Optimized for NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and other Jetson devices
#
# IMPORTANT: PyTorch Installation
# =================================
# PyTorch MUST be installed system-wide (NOT in the virtual environment) for CUDA support.
# The reinstall_skyguard.sh script will automatically install PyTorch if it's not found.
# Alternatively, install manually before running the installation:
#
# For JetPack 6.1:
#   wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v61/pytorch/torch-2.5.0a0+872d972e41.nv24.08.17622132-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl
#   pip3 install torch-2.5.0a0+872d972e41.nv24.08.17622132-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl
#   pip3 install torchvision
#
# For other JetPack versions, see: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson/
#
# The virtual environment will be created with --system-site-packages to access system PyTorch.
# torch/torchvision/torchaudio are commented out below to prevent installation in the venv.

# AI/ML - PyTorch with CUDA support
